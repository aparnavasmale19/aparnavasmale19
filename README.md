# What is GitHub?

GitHub is a website used to store code online.  
It helps us to save, share and manage our projects.

## Why We Use GitHub
- To keep our code safe
- To share code with others
- To work together in a team
- To show our projects to interviewers

## Simple Example
GitHub works like Google Drive but for code.
We create a repository (folder), and upload our project into it.

## What I Am Doing Here
I am learning how to:
- Create a repository
- Upload code
- Add README file

This is only for learning and practice purpose.
